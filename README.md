3. **Student Functions**: View courses, check grades, generate transcripts
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with invalid data, empty states, permission boundaries

### API Testing
You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl:

```bash
# Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"identifier":"teacher1","password":"teacher123","role":"teacher"}'

# Test teacher dashboard (requires authentication)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/teacher/dashboard \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=<session-cookie>"
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper indexes
- **Session Storage**: MongoDB-based session storage for scalability

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Backend**: Create routes in the appropriate route file
2. **Models**: Update or create new Mongoose models as needed
3. **Frontend**: Add UI components and JavaScript functionality
4. **Testing**: Test new features thoroughly

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)

- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Checklist

1. **Environment Variables**: Set production values in config.env
2. **Database**: Use a production MongoDB instance (MongoDB Atlas recommended)
3. **Session Secret**: Use a strong, unique session secret
4. **HTTPS**: Enable HTTPS in production
5. **Process Management**: Use PM2 or similar for process management

### Example Production Deployment

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2

# Start application with PM2
pm2 start server.js --name "school-db-system"

# Save PM2 configuration
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```
